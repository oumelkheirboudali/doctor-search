Doctor Search is a web application that has a search engine for doctors relevant to a specific medical condition.

With the search engine, you can filter out doctors by gender and location (state). 
You can also sort the results by first/last name ascending/descending.

Implements the BetterDoctor API for database of doctors. Please note I have the free tier plan, which only displays a max of 10 doctors per query.

You can find the web application hosted on: gitback.net
